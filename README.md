# NLP-for-Telugu-Language

In this github repo, the code for each of research papers are placed as zip folders.

If anyone want train/test/validation split of the datasets that I mentioned in my papers, please refer the below hugging face link:
https://huggingface.co/mounikaiiith
The hugging face link consists of five different Telugu datasets.
1. Telugu sentiment dataset - The dataset contains 34,142 sentences. We considered three labels as "positive", "negative", and "neutral". The data is divided as 70%-training, 20%-testing, 10%-validation split.
2. Telugu emotion dataset - The dataset contains 34,142 sentences. We considered five basic labels as "happy", "sad", "anger", "fear", and "no emotion". The data is divided as 70%-training, 20%-testing, 10%-validation split.
3. Telugu hatespeech dataset - The dataset contains 34,142 sentences. We considered two labels as as "yes" and "no". The data is divided as 70%-training, 20%-testing, 10%-validation split.
4. Telugu sarcasm dataset - The dataset contains 34,142 sentences. We considered two labels as as "yes" and "no". The data is divided as 70%-training, 20%-testing, 10%-validation split.
5. Telugu clickbait dataset - The dataset contains 112,657 headline sentences. We considered two labels as "yes" and "no". The data is divided as 70%-training, 20%-testing, 10%-validation split.

If anyone want to use the pretrained feature representations that we developed from scratch on Telugu language, please refer the below hugging face links:
